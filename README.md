# TypeScript Form

A simple, responsive form built with **React**, **Material UI**, and **TypeScript**. This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic, well-validated form with a modern UI/UX, while leveraging TypeScript’s static type-checking features to improve maintainability and developer productivity.


## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**  
  Provides static type checking to prevent runtime errors and enforce consistent data structures.

- **React**  
  A powerful library for building user interfaces, enabling component-based architecture and efficient state management.

- **Material UI (MUI)**  
  Implements Google's Material Design for responsive, modern UI components such as grids, buttons, text fields, and more.

- **Axios**  
  A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests.

- **MySQL & MySQL Workbench**  
  MySQL is used as the project's database. MySQL Workbench is used to manage and interact with the database.

- **Create React App / React Scripts**  
  Simplifies the bootstrapping and configuration of the React project.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Fields:**  
  Build and validate user input with text fields, dropdowns, and custom validation logic (e.g., ensuring a 10-digit contact number).

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Leverages Material UI’s Grid system to ensure the form looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Custom Styling and Theming:**  
  Includes a bank-themed background image, transparent overlays, and custom-styled input elements with white borders and text.

- **Type Safety:**  
  Utilizes TypeScript to catch potential issues during development, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

## Database

This project uses **MySQL** as its database backend. You can manage the MySQL database using **MySQL Workbench**, which provides a visual interface for database administration. Adjust your API endpoints and connection settings accordingly to integrate with your MySQL database.
